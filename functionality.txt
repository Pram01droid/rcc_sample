// Functionality

// Requirements
1. Admins/Patients can see the list of doctors
2. Admins can only see the list of doctors for their chamber only
3. Admins can modify (Create/Edit/Delete) the routine/schedule of the doctors for their chamber only
4. The availablity for each doctors resets to defaultavailability on every sunday 23:55


Elaboration of point 1.
---> Here we will use filters such as Department type, time, day. (This will be useful for patients)
        -----> Doctor name, chamber details, availablity status

---> POV admins:
    -----> Doctor name , availablity status for their chamber only(covers point 2.)
    -----> They will also get option for each doctor in their chamber for editing info or delete doctor from data and also modifying availablity time. (covers point 3.)
    -----> For creating doctors we throw one form and ask details like name, department, chamber, defaultavailability.


Elaboration of point 3.
---> What we need to do here is for modifying doctor's schedule we need a pop up window in which it will have a list structure (sorted acc. to day and time) and we have for each item a delete button so that we can remove this dynamically. Also we will provide a add button on the bottom to add a new schedule by giving an inplace time and day form and save it as soon as we click anywhere outside this form in the pop up window.

Elaboration of point 4.
---> Maintain a time okay for each doctor make weekavailablability = defaultavailablity on sunday 23:55, make sure this condition gets checked every week on sunday.

// Coding part Requirements
---> keep in mind the following:
1. HTML, CSS and JavaScript should be in separate files.
2. For now we will use .json file and consider it as a database.
3. Keep the code simple and refactored with comments (using industry standard coding practice)

// unfactored
func()
{
    cout<<"Thee";
  Cout<<"f";
}

// refectored
functionToPrint()
{
    cout<<"THee";
    cout<<"f";
}

//smoothening the experience
1. need to search the filters with name-autofill along with drop-down. for example:
while searching for doctors, along with the drop down, we need to be able to fill the searchbar like 
sou... and the names containing "sou" should appear.
2. need to add contact numbers for the chambers.
3. need to have time as am/pm rather than 24-hour format.
4. it will be better if there is one-to-one mapping from doctors to departments (as each doctor 
belongs to only one department only). so that, when someone filters a (wrong) department first, and
then filters using the name of the doctor, the department filter automatically sets to that doctor's
departrment.
